# Vue Atom Snippets

## Description

This package is an Atom port of the excellent [`Vue VSCode Snippets`](https://github.com/sdras/vue-vscode-snippets) by @sdras.

My main motivation for creating this package is that I often need to switch between Atom and VSCode and I really, really love the snippets Sarah Drasner crafted for VSCode.

The goals of this package are

* To remain compatible with the `vue-vscode-snippets` - all prefixes from the original repository should be available and should produce the same output.

* Implement Atom-specific tweaks and improvements which can help productivity.

* The package does not aim to become an "ubermegablob" of snippets but rather focus on parts which are useful in every day code work.

* The scope of the snippets is the core ecosystem around Vue, including `vue`, `vuex`, `vue-router` and `nuxt`. This is just a baseline, others may added as needed.

## Plugin installation

`apm install vue-atom-snippets`

## Availability

The snippets provided by the plugin will be available in all **.vue** files as well as **.js** (e.g. `nuxt.config.js`).
